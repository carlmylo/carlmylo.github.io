![A screenshot of Rock Band 3's I/O custom settings, showing "Emulated MIDI Devices", "device type", and "device selection" highlighted in tan with a solid outline, and "Pad Handler Mode" and "Keep Pads Connected" highlighted in blue with a dotted outline.](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/cust/io.png "I/O")

* ![A blue square with a dotted outline.](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/cust/smallblue.png "Tan Square") **Performance Tweaks**: 
	* **Change "`Pad Handler Mode`" to "`Multi-threaded`"** - May help with thread distribution, which improves performance.
	* **Enable "`Keep Pads Connected`"** - This can help fix a problem with certain instrument controllers softlocking the game when RPCS3 interfaces, such as the RPCN invites, come up.
