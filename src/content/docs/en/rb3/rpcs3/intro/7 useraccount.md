By default, RPCS3's default username is "`User`" when you're playing offline.

Changing it is very easy!

In RPCS3, go to **Manage > User Accounts** 
![RPCS3 showing "User Accounts" option under the "Manage" menu.](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/conf/rpcs3user.png "RPCS3: User Accounts")

Once you're there, **click on the default username (00000001 - User) and then click "Rename User".**

**Now change it** to whatever you want, then close it out.
