import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Now, **go to the folder where you extracted RPCS3.** Keep this folder open in the background. **Open up RPCS3**.  
**Tick**:
* "`Create desktop shortcut`"
* "`Create Start Menu shortcut`"
* "`I have read the Quickstart guide`"
* "`Do not show again`"  

**Disable**:
* "`Show at startup`"  

After that, **click "`Continue`."**

## Firmware

**Drag** the **PS3UPDAT.PUP** file you just downloaded from Sony's website **into RPCS3**. 

![A GIF of PS3UPDAT.PUP being dragged into RPCS3.](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/install/rpcs3fwdnd.gif "PST3UPDAT.PUP")

**Click "`Yes`"** when the firmware installer prompts you.

**Let it install.**

**When it finishes, click "`OK`."**

It will start compiling modules to load the PS3 XMB into the emulator, which may take a few minutes. **You can either let it do its thing or close it.**

## Rock Band 3

Next, **open a new file browser window. Now go to the folder where you have your copy of Rock Band 3 stored and drag the folder into RPCS3's "`games`" folder**. Again, you're on your own when it comes to finding a copy. [["PS3 Disc Dumper" is the easiest way]](https://youtu.be/mRxSKxoYt_g).

After dragging it in, click "`Refresh`" in RPCS3.

## Rock Band 3 Deluxe

Finally, let's install Rock Band 3 Deluxe.

This is a must-have mod, which also fixes some critical bugs RPCS3 has with Rock Band 3. On top of that, it adds [**[many great features]**](https://rb3dx.milohax.org/features).

[**[Click here to download Rock Band 3 Deluxe]**](https://rb3dx.milohax.org/downloads).

Download either the `Nightly` or `Beta` version 

[![Rock Band 3 Deluxe's .zip archive in Edge's download tray.](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/install/rb3dxdl.png)](https://rb3dx.milohax.org/downloads "RB3DX-PS3.zip")

**When it's finished downloading, extract the archive**.  

![Rock Band 3 Deluxe's .zip being extracted with 7-Zip.](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/install/rb3dxext.png "RB3DX-PS3.zip")

**When it finishes extracting, drag the PKG file into RPCS3 and click "`Yes`"** on the prompt, just like you did earlier with the PS3UPDAT.PUP file.  

![A GIF of Rock Band 3 Deluxe's PKG file being dragged into RPCS3.](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/install/rpcs3rb3dxdnd.gif "Rock Band 3 Deluxe PKG file")

![A screenshot of RPCS3's Decrypter/ Installer asking if the user wants to install the Rock Band 3 Deluxe package file.](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/install/rpcs3pkg.png "PKG Decrypter/ Installer")

The best way to check if Rock Band 3 Deluxe installed correctly is to enable `Prefer Game Data Icons` under `View > Game List Icons`.

![A screenshot of RPCS3, showing a cursor over "Prefer Game Data Icons"](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/install/rpcs3gamedataicon.png "RPCS3 Game List")

If it installed successfully, you should see that the Rock Band 3 icon has changed.

![A screenshot of RPCS3's game library, showing an updated icon for Rock Band 3. It's now using the Rock Band 3 Deluxe icon.](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/install/rpcs3rb3dxicon.png "RPCS3 Game List")

You can also rename the game in the list to "Rock Band 3 Deluxe" if you wish. To do this, right-click on "Rock Band 3" and select "`Rename In Game List`."
