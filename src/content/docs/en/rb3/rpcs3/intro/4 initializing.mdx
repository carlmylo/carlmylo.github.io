Now, **go to the folder where you extracted RPCS3.** Keep this folder open in the background. **Open up RPCS3**.  
**Tick**:
* "`Create desktop shortcut`"
* "`Create Start Menu shortcut`"
* "`I have read the Quickstart guide`"
* "`Do not show again`"  

**Disable**:
* "`Show at startup`"  

After that, **click "`Continue`."**

## Firmware

**Drag** the **PS3UPDAT.PUP** file you just downloaded from Sony's website **into RPCS3**. 

<Image src={rpcs3fwdnd} alt="PS3UPDAT.PUP being dragged into RPCS3." />

**Click "`Yes`"** when the firmware installer prompts you.  
<Image src={fwinstall} alt="RPCS3's Firmware Installer asking the user if they want to install the firmware named 'PS3UPDAT.PUP'." />

**Let it install.**  
<Image src={rpcs3fw} alt="RPCS3's Firmware Installer in the middle of installing firmware version 4.90." />

**When it finishes, click "`OK`."**  
<Image src={rpcs3fwdone} alt="RPCS3's Firmware Installer after a successful install of PS3 firmware and LLE modules." />

It will start compiling modules to load the PS3 XMB into the emulator, which may take a few minutes. **You can either let it do its thing or close it.**

## Rock Band 3

Next, **open a new file browser window. Now go to the folder where you have your copy of Rock Band 3 stored and drag the folder into RPCS3's "`games`" folder**. Again, you're on your own when it comes to finding a copy.

After dragging it in, click "`Refresh`" in RPCS3.

## Rock Band 3 Deluxe

Finally, let's install Rock Band 3 Deluxe.

This is a must-have mod, which also fixes some critical bugs RPCS3 has with Rock Band 3. On top of that, it adds <a href="https://rb3dx.milohax.org/features" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>[many great features]</b></a>.

<a href="https://rb3dx.milohax.org/downloads" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>[Click here to download Rock Band 3 Deluxe]</b></a>.

Download the PS3 version.  
<a href="https://rb3dx.milohax.org/downloads" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><Image src={rb3dxdl} alt="Rock Band 3 Deluxe's .zip archive in Edge's download tray." /></a>

**When it's finished downloading, extract the archive**.  
<Image src={rb3dxext} alt="Rock Band 3 Deluxe's .zip being extracted with 7-Zip." />

**When it finishes extracting, drag the PKG file into RPCS3 and click "`Yes`"** on the prompt, just like you did earlier with the PS3UPDAT.PUP file.

<Image src={rpcs3pkg} alt="RPCS3's Decrypter/ Installer asking if the user wants to install the Rock Band 3 Deluxe package file." />

The best way to check if Rock Band 3 Deluxe installed correctly is to enable `Prefer Game Data Icons` under `View > Game List Icons`.  
<Image src={rpcs3gamedataicon} alt="RPCS3, showing a cursor over 'Prefer Game Data Icons'." />

If it installed successfully, you should see that the Rock Band 3 icon has changed.  
<Image src={rpcs3rb3dxicon} alt="RPCS3's game library, showing an updated icon for Rock Band 3. It's now using the Rock Band 3 Deluxe icon." />

You can also rename the game in the list to "Rock Band 3 Deluxe" if you wish. To do this, right-click on "Rock Band 3" and select "`Rename In Game List`."
