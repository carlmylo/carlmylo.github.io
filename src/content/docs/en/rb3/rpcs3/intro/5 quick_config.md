## Quick Configuration Profiles

Now that the game is in the library, we'll download some files to adjust RPCS3 for the best experience.  
Below are the quick configuration files. Download a whichever is best for your computer.  

* [[Recommended settings]](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/downloads/customconfigs/recommended.zip) - These are the settings used for the recommended specs listed in [[requirements]](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/gs_reqs#a-computer).
* [[Minimum settings]](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/downloads/customconfigs/minimum.zip) - These are the settings used for the minimum specs listed in [[requirements]](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/gs_reqs#a-computer).

## Applying A Profile
To use these, **click on the settings you want to download then extract the ZIP archives in the folder where you extracted RPCS3**. It should combine folders automatically if you did it right.  
In the GIF example below, the "Recommended" requirements settings archive (recommended.zip) was downloaded and its contents were moved into RPCS3's folder.
