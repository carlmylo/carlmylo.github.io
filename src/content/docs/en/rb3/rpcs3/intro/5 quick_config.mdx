Now that the game is in the library, we'll download some files to adjust RPCS3 for the best experience.  
Below are the quick configuration files. Download a whichever is best for your computer.  

* [[Recommended settings]](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/downloads/customconfigs/recommended.zip) - These are the settings used for the recommended specs listed in <a href="https://rb3pc.milohax.org/gs_reqs#a-computer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[requirements]</a>.
* [[Minimum settings]](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/downloads/customconfigs/minimum.zip) - These are the settings used for the minimum specs listed in <a href="https://rb3pc.milohax.org/gs_reqs#a-computer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[requirements]</a>.

## Applying A Profile
To use these, **click on the settings you want to download then extract the ZIP archives in the folder where you extracted RPCS3**. It should combine folders automatically if you did it right.  
In the GIF example below, the "Recommended" requirements settings archive (recommended.zip) was downloaded and its contents were moved into RPCS3's folder.

## Experimental Low End Configuration
* [[Potato Settings]](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/downloads/customconfigs/potato.zip) - The same as the minimum configuration but using OpenGL, meant for computers with integrated graphics. Double this up with black backgrounds and your potato might boot Rock Band 3 on RPCS3. **This is not recommended!**
