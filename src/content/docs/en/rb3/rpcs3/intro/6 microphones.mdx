Ready to sing? RPCS3 lets you set up to 3 microphones to sing with.  
Just about any microphone can be used to sing.

To get started setting up microphones, make sure Rock Band 3 isn't running.  
**<a href="https://rb3pc.milohax.org/gs_quick_config" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[Also, make sure you have installed a Quick Configuration Profile from the previous page]</a>**.  

**Right click on Rock Band 3** in RPCS3, then click on “**`Change Custom Configuration`**”.

Switch to the "`Audio`" tab.

* ![A tan square with a solid outline.](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/cust/smalltan.png "Tan Square") **To set microphones up**: 
	* **Set "`Microphone Type`" to "`Standard`"**.
	* **Select an input device in "`Mic1`", "`Mic2`", and "`Mic3`"** for vocals. When not playing vocals, "`Mic1`" will be used for voice chat.

When you're done, click "`Apply`" then "`Save custom configuration`".  
You can now open Rock Band 3 and sing to your heart's content.
