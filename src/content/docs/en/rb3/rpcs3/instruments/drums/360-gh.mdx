	Need one?
	* [[Buy one from RetroCultMods (RCM Shop)]](https://shop.retrocultmods.com/products/360-wireless-receiver-for-controllers-guitars-etc)
	* [[Buy one from Roll Limitless]](https://rolllimitless.com/xbox-360-wireless-receiver/)
	* [[Buy one from Amazon]](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B076GZFLR3)
	* Please note that any generic Xbox 360 Wireless Gaming Receiver should work fine!
* Velocity sensitivity doesn't seem to work.
* Can be used to play on Pro Drums to an extent but it's not suggested.
* Gem colors do not match the pads.
* RPCN Menus (for sending or accepting online invites) may cause a softlock. You may need an alternative input method to navigate these menus, such as [[a typing keyboard or a gamepad]](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/ctrls#gamepads).

This is so you can change configuration profiles in case you want to play other games.
