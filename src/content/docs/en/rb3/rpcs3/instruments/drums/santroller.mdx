* **Please note that your Santroller Configurator may have different settings, depending on how your drums were connected/modded.** If you purchased your drums pre-modded, contact the seller for more information.

## Setup
<Aside>Before starting, **make sure you stop Rock Band 3**'s emulation in RPCS3.</Aside>

Be sure to [[download the latest version of Santroller]](https://github.com/santroller/santroller/releases/latest).

After that, start up Santroller.

In the start screen, select your "`Device to program`", "`Connection Method`", and "`Device to Emulate`". This will depend on what device you're using for your drums. In the tutorial screenshots, it was a "`Raspberry Pi Pico`", "`USB Adapter`", and "`Rock Band Drums`"  respectively.  
After selecting your options, click on `Configure`.

<Image src={initdrms} alt="Santroller's initial screen. 'Selected Device' is set to Raspberry Pi Pico and Input Type is set to 'Directly Wired'." />

In "`Controller Settings`", change the following:
* Set "`Device to Emulate`" to "`Rock Band Drums`"
* Enable "`Use USB Passthrough with RPCS3`"

<Image src={consetdrums} alt="Santroller's Controller Settings. The settings reflect exactly what is above." />

**MAKE SURE YOU CLICK ON "`Save Settings`" before closing the program or you will lose progress!**

<Image src={savesan} alt="Santroller with a cursor is hovering over 'Save Settings'." />

When you're done, close Santroller.

You can now launch Rock Band 3!

<Aside type="caution">**Make sure Santroller is closed before starting Rock Band 3**!!! Having Santroller open while launching Rock Band 3 will cause passthrough to fail, which means your drums will not connect!!!</Aside>
