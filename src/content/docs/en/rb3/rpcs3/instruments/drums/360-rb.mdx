## NOTES

* Rock Band 1 Drums can be connected via USB. Rock Band 1 drums are black with grey pads and lack the connectors for cymbals. 

* Rock Band 2 (and later) Drums **require an Xbox 360 Wireless Gaming Receiver for Windows to connect to your computer.**  
![Xbox 360 Wireless Gaming Receiver for Windows](/milohaxguides/assets/instruments/adapters/360.png "Xbox 360 Wireless Gaming Receiver for Windows")
	Need one?
	* [[Buy one from RetroCultMods (RCM Shop)]](https://shop.retrocultmods.com/products/360-wireless-receiver-for-controllers-guitars-etc)
	* [[Buy one from Roll Limitless]](https://rolllimitless.com/xbox-360-wireless-receiver/)
	* [[Buy one from Amazon]](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B076GZFLR3)
	* Please note that any generic Xbox 360 Wireless Gaming Receiver should work fine!
* Works **with or without** the Pro Cymbal expansions.
	* Make sure to configure which cymbals are connected within Rock Band 3.
		* `Menu > Options > Drum Options`
* Velocity sensitivity doesn't seem to work.
* RPCN Menus (for sending or accepting online invites) may cause a softlock. You may need an alternative input method to navigate these menus, such as [[a typing keyboard or a gamepad]](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/ctrls#gamepads).

**Click on the Pads icon at the top of RPCS3**.  
<Image src={rpcs3pad} alt="The Pads menu in RPCS3." />

It’s suggested to create a new configuration by clicking `Add Configuration` at the top right of the `Pads` window.  
This is so you can change configuration profiles in case you want to play other games.  
<Image src={rpcs3padprofadd} alt="The top right of RPCS3's Pads window. 'Add Configuration' is being clicked on by the mouse cursor" />
Follow the instructions and/or match the assignments below.

## Pad Information

| Handlers | Devices |
|:--------:|:-------:|
| XInput | XInput Pad |

| Device Class | Device Subtype |
|:------------:|:--------------:|
| Drums | Rock Band Pro |

## Mapping

By default, XInput has most things bound correctly. You only need to remap the following:

| **RPCS3** | **XInput** | **Drums** |
|:--------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|
| R1 | ![Left Stick Click](/milohaxguides/assets/instruments/buttons/360/lsc.png "Left Stick Click") | ![Second Foot Pedal](/milohaxguides/assets/instruments/buttons/drums/rb/kp.png "Second Foot Pedal") | 
| L3 | ![Right Stick Click](/milohaxguides/assets/instruments/buttons/360/rsc.png "Right Stick Click") | Pad Modifier | 
| R3 | ![Right Bumper](/milohaxguides/assets/instruments/buttons/360/rb.png "Right Bumper") | Cymbal Modifier |

* Rock Band Drums send multiple button presses out at once. For example, a Red pad will send "`B`" and "`Right Stick Click`" (which translates to "`Circle`" and "`L3`".) Keep in mind these are needed to the emulator to tell your cymbals apart.
	* It's strongly suggested to bind an Xbox controller like the Mapping screenshot below then swapping the Device to your Xbox 360 Rock Band Drums.

#### Profile

[[Download Profile]](https://github.com/hmxmilohax/rb3-pc/raw/refs/heads/main/downloads/instrument-repo/Xbox%20Rock%20Band%20Drums.7z)

<Aside type="caution">This is not recommended if you're using multiple controllers at once.</Aside>

After downloading the profile,

1. Extract the .7z file.
2. Drag the `input configs` folder into the `configs` folder where you have RPCS3 in.  
><Image src={instrepoinstall} alt="Installing a configuration profile from the Instrument Repo" />

3. After that, you can select the profile in the **“Pads”** menu.  
><Image src={rpcs3padprofile} alt="RPCS3's Gamepad Settings, showing the cursor over a profile." />

Most of the time, these controller profiles should work out of the box. If they don’t, try changing the controller listed in “`Devices`”, next to the “`Refresh`” button until it receives an input. You can edit this while the game is running.

#### Bindings

* To bind multiple buttons to one RPCS3 button, hold Shift then click on the RPCS3 button you want to assign multiple buttons to.
