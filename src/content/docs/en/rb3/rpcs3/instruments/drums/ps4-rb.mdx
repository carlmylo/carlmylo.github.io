## NOTES

* Requires installing and running the latest [Minatsuki](https://github.com/yanagiragi/Minatsuki/) and [Minatsuki-Pro-Drums-Plus](https://github.com/stefman69/Minatsuki-Pro-Drums-Plus) files.
* You need a Bluetooth receiver to connect these drums to your computer.
    * Latency may be an issue depending on your Bluetooth receiver. This may make it difficult to calibrate.
* Works **with or without** the Pro Cymbal expansions.
    * Make sure to configure which cymbals are connected within Rock Band 3.
        * `Menu > Options > Drum Options`
* RPCN Menus (for sending or accepting online invites) may cause a softlock. You may need an alternative input method to navigate these menus, such as [[a typing keyboard or a gamepad]](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/ctrls#gamepads).

**Click on the Pads icon at the top of RPCS3**.  
<Image src={rpcs3pad} alt="The Pads menu in RPCS3." />

It’s suggested to create a new configuration by clicking `Add Configuration` at the top right of the `Pads` window.  
This is so you can change configuration profiles in case you want to play other games.  
<Image src={rpcs3padprofadd} alt="The top right of RPCS3's Pads window. 'Add Configuration' is being clicked on by the mouse cursor" />
Follow the instructions and/or match the assignments below.

### Initial Setup
First, we're going to download the latest version of <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[Python 3]</a>.  
<a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[Click here to go to the download page for Python 3]</a>.  
<a href="https://www.python.org/downloads" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><Image src={pydl} alt="Python's download website. A cursor hovers over 'Download Python 3.12.6.'" /></a>

Once it finishes downloading, open the installer.  
In the installer:  
1. Activate `Add python.exe to PATH`
2. Click `Install now`  
<Image src={pyinstall} alt="Python's download website. A cursor hovers over 'Download Python 3.12.6.'" />

Now, go to <a href="https://github.com/yanagiragi/Minatsuki" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[Minatsuki's Github page]</a> and download the code ZIP.  
<a href="https://github.com/yanagiragi/Minatsuki/archive/refs/heads/main.zip" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><Image src={mina1} alt="Minatsuki's Github page. The green 'Code' button was clicked and the cursor is over the 'Download ZIP' option." /></a>
Extract the `.zip` file into a folder.  

Now go to <a href="https://github.com/stefman69/Minatsuki-Pro-Drums-Plus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[Minatsuki-Pro-Drums-Plus' Github page]</a> and download the code ZIP.  
<a href="https://github.com/stefman69/Minatsuki-Pro-Drums-Plus/archive/refs/heads/main.zip" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><Image src={mina2} alt="Minatsuki-Pro-Drums-Plus' Github page. The green 'Code' button was clicked and the cursor is over the 'Download ZIP' option." /></a>

Combine Minatsuki-Pro-Drums-Plus' files with the Minatsuki files.  
After that, click on the address bar at the top of the File Explorer, type in `cmd` then press Enter.  
<Image src={mina3} alt="A folder that contains the combined files of Minatsuki and Minatsuki-Pro-Drums-Plus. The address bar has been clicked and it says 'cmd'." />


In the command line, type in `pip install -r requirements.txt` then press Enter.
<Image src={mina4} alt="A Windows command line. The command 'pip install -r requirements.txt' was typed in and entered and it downloaded." />

After it installs, type in `pip install vgamepad` then press Enter.  
<Image src={mina5} alt="A screenshot of a Windows command line. The command 'pip install vgamepad' was typed in and entered and it downloaded." />

You may have to install ViGEm Bus. You can download that from <a href="https://vigembusdriver.com/download/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[here]</a>.

### Usage
Synchronize your drums to your computer's Bluetooth receiver.
<Image src={ps41} alt="A screenshot of a Windows' Bluetooth devices. It shows a Mad Catz Rock Band 4 Drum Set." />

Double click the `main_xinput.py` file.  
<Image src={ps42} alt="Windows Explorer with the cursor over 'main_xinput.py' and it is highlighted." />

When the command line window opens, type in the number of your drum kit and press Enter. Sometimes, it might show up as multiple inputs but it's fine. Just pick one and press Enter.  
<Image src={ps43} alt="A screenshot of a command line running the 'main_xinput.py' script. It shows the Rock Band 4 kit drum kit along with other controllers in the selection. The Rock Band kit's number was selected and Enter was pressed." />

Minimize this command line window. Make sure it stays running in the background.

## Mapping

You simply need to assign the Handler, Device, and Device Class/Type.

<summary>"I refuse to use Python"</summary>

If you refuse to set up Python, you won’t have access to cymbals and it will provide an overall worse experience.
