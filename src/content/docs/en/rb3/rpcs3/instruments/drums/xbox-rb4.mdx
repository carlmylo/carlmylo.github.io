## NOTES

* Requires installing and running [[**RB4InstrummentMapper**]](https://github.com/TheNathannator/RB4InstrumentMapper/) along with its dependencies.
* **Linux** users can install [[`xone` kernel drivers]](https://github.com/dlundqvist/xone) to use Xbox One peripherals.
* You need a Microsoft Xbox Wireless Adapter to connect these drums to your computer.  
    ![Microsoft Xbox Wireless Adapter for Windows 10](/milohaxguides/instruments/adapters/xbone.png "Microsoft Xbox Wireless Adapter for Windows 10")  
* Works **with or without** the Pro Cymbal expansions.
    * Make sure to configure which cymbals are connected within Rock Band 3.
        * `Menu > Options > Drum Options`
* RPCN Menus (for sending or accepting online invites) may cause a softlock. You may need an alternative input method to navigate these menus, such as [[a typing keyboard or a gamepad]](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/ctrls#gamepads).

**Click on the Pads icon at the top of RPCS3**.  
<Image src={rpcs3pad} alt="The Pads menu in RPCS3." />

It’s suggested to create a new configuration by clicking `Add Configuration` at the top right of the `Pads` window.  
This is so you can change configuration profiles in case you want to play other games.  
<Image src={rpcs3padprofadd} alt="The top right of RPCS3's Pads window. 'Add Configuration' is being clicked on by the mouse cursor" />
Follow the instructions and/or match the assignments below.

## Pad Information

| Handlers | Devices |

## Additional Setup

Please refer to RB4InstrumentMapper's documentation.  
[[Click here to go there]](https://github.com/TheNathannator/RB4InstrumentMapper/blob/main/README.md).

<details>
<summary>**Having issues with your Xbox One instrument?**</summary>

1. Go to `Start` > `Settings`  > `Apps` > `Installed apps`
2. Look for `Microsoft GameInput` and uninstall the latest version.  
Please note that it may reinstall itself after a reboot. We are looking for better solutions.

## Mapping

### Controller Emulation Mode: ViGEmBus (RPCS3 compatibility)

This is the recommended mode and should not require any mapping. You simply need to assign the Handler, Device, and Device Class/Type.

<div align="center"><Image src={drmsxomapping} alt="Mapping" /></div>

<details>
<summary>Controller Emulation Mode: ViGEmBus</summary>

This is not suggested as it requires lots of manual mapping. You should instead use **ViGEmBus (RPCS3 compatibility)**.

#### Bindings

By default, XInput has most things bound correctly. You only need to remap the following:

| **RPCS3** | **XInput** | **Drums** |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| R1  | ![Left Stick Click](/milohaxguides/assets/instruments/buttons/360/lsc.png "Left Stick Click") | ![Second Foot Pedal](/milohaxguides/assets/instruments/buttons/drums/rb/kp.png "Second Foot Pedal") |
| L3  | ![Right Stick Click](/milohaxguides/assets/instruments/buttons/360/rsc.png "Right Stick Click") | Pad Modifier |
| R3  | ![Right Bumper](/milohaxguides/assets/instruments/buttons/360/rb.png "Right Bumper") | Cymbal Modifier |

### Advanced Mapping

* Rock Band Drums send multiple button presses out at once. For example, a Red pad will send “`B`” and “`Right Stick Click`” (which translates to “`Circle`” and “`L3`”.) Keep in mind these are needed to the emulator to tell your cymbals apart.
    * It’s strongly suggested to bind an Xbox controller like the Mapping screenshot below then swapping the Device to your Xbox 360 Rock Band Drums.
* To bind multiple buttons to one RPCS3 button, hold Shift then click on the RPCS3 button you want to assign multiple buttons to.

| **RPCS3** | **Drums** |
|:---:|:---:|
| Cross | ![Green Pad](/milohaxguides/assets/instruments/buttons/drums/rb/gp.png "Green Pad") |
| Circle | ![Red Pad](/milohaxguides/assets/instruments/buttons/drums/rb/rp.png "Red Pad") |

| Triangle | ![Yellow Pad](/milohaxguides/assets/instruments/buttons/drums/rb/yp.png "Yellow Pad") |
| R3  | Cymbal Modifier |
| D-Pad: Up | Yellow Cymbal Modifier |
| D-Pad: Down | Blue Cymbal Modifier |
| L3  | Pad Modifier |
| L1  | ![Foot Pedal](/milohaxguides/assets/instruments/buttons/drums/rb/kp.png "Foot Pedal") |

| Cross | ![A Button](/milohaxguides/assets/instruments/buttons/360/a.png "A Button") |
| Circle | ![B Button](/milohaxguides/assets/instruments/buttons/360/b.png "B Button") |

| Triangle | ![Y Button](/milohaxguides/assets/instruments/buttons/360/y.png "Y Button") |

### Profile
[[Download Profile]](https://github.com/hmxmilohax/rb3-pc/raw/refs/heads/main/downloads/instrument-repo/Xbox%20Rock%20Band%20Drums.7z)

<Aside type="caution">This is not recommended if you're using multiple controllers at once.</Aside>

After downloading the profile,

1. Extract the .7z file.
2. Drag the `input configs` folder into the `configs` folder where you have RPCS3 in.  
><Image src={instrepoinstall} alt="Installing a configuration profile from the Instrument Repo" />

3. After that, you can select the profile in the **“Pads”** menu.  
><Image src={rpcs3padprofile} alt="RPCS3's Gamepad Settings, showing the cursor over a profile." />

Most of the time, these controller profiles should work out of the box. If they don’t, try changing the controller listed in “`Devices`”, next to the “`Refresh`” button until it receives an input. You can edit this while the game is running.
