## Setup

### Initial Setup:
Put the Roll Limitless Adapter in firmware updating mode. To do this, press and hold the rectangular button on the top of the adapter, near the micro USB port.  
<Image src={fwbutton} alt="A Roll Limitless adapter, showing the firmware button circled in red." />

* While still holding the button, plug it into your computer. If done successfully, the Roll Limitless will show up as a removable drive.
* [[Download the latest "Rock Band" firmware for the drums from the official website]](https://rolllimitless.com/september-15th-2024-firmwares/).
* Place the firmware file on the Roll Limitless device while it's in firmware updating mode (showing up as a removable drive). When it completes, safely remove the device.
* Plug the Roll Limitless adapter back into your computer while holding down the round Start button.  
<Image src={startbutton} alt="A Roll Limitless adapter, showing the start button circled in red." />

Now, [**[go to Zadig's website]**](https://zadig.akeo.ie/) and **download the latest version, then open it** up.

Click on **Options** then **List All Devices**.  
<Image src={zadiglistall} alt="Zadig showing 'List All Devices' under 'Options' highlighted." />

You should now see devices listed. **Switch it to your Roll Limitless**. In this example, we're using the Mustang Pro Guitar, which shows up as "Harmonix RB3 Mustang Guitar for PlayStation® 3".  
<Image src={zadigsel} alt="Zadig showing 'Harmonix RB3 Mustang Guitar for PlayStation® 3' highlighted in the devices listed." />

**After selecting the right device, you should see the option to replace the driver. _MAKE SURE YOU ARE REPLACING THE DRIVER ONLY FOR THE ROLL LIMITLESS!!_** Click Replace Driver.  
<Image src={zadigreplace} alt="Zadig with 'Replace Driver' highlighted." />

A warning will appear. **Again, make sure you have selected your Roll Limitless.** After you have made sure, **click** "**Yes**."  
<Image src={zadigwarning} alt="A screenshot of Zadig warning the user that they're about to modify a system driver, with 'Yes' highlighted" />

It will then install the driver. As the program says, it may take a few minutes.  
<Image src={zadigprogress} alt="A screenshot of Zadig in the middle of a driver install." />

If everything goes well, you will get this message:  
<Image src={zadigdone} alt="Zadig telling the user that the driver was installed successfully with 'Close' highlighted." />

**Close Zadig** and, **with the dongle** still **connected**, **open up RPCS3** and **open Rock Band 3**.

Turn your controller on and you should see it automatically assign a player number.  
<Image src={protaron} alt="A Mustang Pro Guitar with the second player LED lit up." />

Likewise, in Rock Band 3, you will see the instrument ready to join.  
<Image src={rb3player} alt="Rock Band 3 with a Pro Guitar ready to join." />

From this point, you can just connect your Roll Limitless whenever you want without having to repeat this setup process!

<Aside type="caution">RPCN Menus (for sending or accepting online invites) will cause a softlock. You will need an alternative input method to navigate these menus, such as a [[typing keyboard or a gamepad.]](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/ctrls#gamepads)</Aside>

<summary>Uninstalling</summary>
Applying a Zadig driver on a device will make it only work on applications with passthrough. Thankfully, reverting this is very easy.  

Open the Start menu and search for `Device Manager`. Open it.  
<Image src={startdevman} alt="Windows' Start menu, with a result of 'Device Manager'." />

Scroll down until you find the `Universal Serial Bus devices` category.  
Expand it and right click the instrument you applied the Zadig driver on and then select `Uninstall device`.  
In this example, it's the Pro Guitar (`Harmonix RB3 Mustang Guitar for PlayStation 3®`).  
<Image src={devman} alt="Device Manager, with a right click menu that popped up. The cursor is over 'Uninstall Device.'" />

In the next window that pops up, make sure to tick `Attempt to remove the driver for this device.`  
After that, click `Uninstall` and that's it!  

<Image src={devmanun} alt="The device uninstall prompt. 'Attempt to remove the driver for this device' is ticked and the cursor is over 'Uninstall.'" />

When you disconnect then reconnect the device, it will revert back to the original driver.

**Click on the Pads icon at the top of RPCS3**.  
<Image src={rpcs3pad} alt="The Pads menu in RPCS3." />

It’s suggested to create a new configuration by clicking `Add Configuration` at the top right of the `Pads` window.  
This is so you can change configuration profiles in case you want to play other games.  
<Image src={rpcs3padprofadd} alt="The top right of RPCS3's Pads window. 'Add Configuration' is being clicked on by the mouse cursor" />
Follow the instructions and/or match the assignments below.

## NOTES
* Velocity sensitivity doesn't seem to work.

### Additional Setup:
1. Put the Roll Limitless Adapter in firmware updating mode. To do this, press and hold the rectangular button on the top of the adapter, near the micro USB port.  
<Image src={fwbutton} alt="A Roll Limitless adapter, showing the firmware button circled in red." />
2. While still holding the button, plug it into your computer. If done successfully, the Roll Limitless will show up as a removable drive.
3. [[Download the latest "Universal" firmware for the Roll Limitless from the official website]](https://rolllimitless.com/firmwares/).
4. Place the firmware file on the Roll Limitless device while it's in firmware updating mode (showing up as a removable drive). When it completes, safely remove the device.
5. Plug the Roll Limitless adapter back into your computer while holding down the round Start button.  
<Image src={startbutton} alt="A Roll Limitless adapter, showing the start button circled in red." />
6. Verify that Windows has detected the Roll Limitless adapter by searching for `joy.cpl` in the Start menu.  
<Image src={joycpl} alt="Windows showing the search results of joy.cpl." />
7. If it shows up, it's ready to go. If not, make sure you're plugging it in while holding down the round Start button.

## Profile

[[Download Profile]](https://github.com/hmxmilohax/rb3-pc/raw/refs/heads/main/downloads/instrument-repo/Roll%20Limitless%20Drums.7z)

<details>
<summary>How do I use profiles?</summary>

<Aside type="caution">This is not recommended if you're using multiple controllers at once.</Aside>

After downloading the profile,

1. Extract the .7z file.
2. Drag the `input configs` folder into the `configs` folder where you have RPCS3 in.  
><Image src={instrepoinstall} alt="Installing a configuration profile from the Instrument Repo" />

3. After that, you can select the profile in the **“Pads”** menu.  
><Image src={rpcs3padprofile} alt="RPCS3's Gamepad Settings, showing the cursor over a profile." />

Most of the time, these controller profiles should work out of the box. If they don’t, try changing the controller listed in “`Devices`”, next to the “`Refresh`” button until it receives an input. You can edit this while the game is running.
