## NOTES
<Aside>**Please don't buy new Raphnets in 2025!** They are no longer the go-to solution.</Aside>
* Velocity sensitivity doesn't seem to work.
* Can be used to play on Pro Drums to an extent but it's not suggested.
* Gem colors do not match the pads.
* This was tested with a Raphnet "Classic controller to USB adapter".
	* If the controller doesn't work at all, try installing [[Raphnet's management tool]](https://www.raphnet-tech.com/products/adapter_manager/index.php).
* It is strongly recommended to get a V3 adapter instead.
	* [[Buy one from RetroCultMods (RCM Shop).]](https://shop.retrocultmods.com/products/v3-wii-adapter-for-clone-hero-and-rb4-rock-band-4)
	* [[Buy one from Etsy.]](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1536358024/)
* RPCN Menus (for sending or accepting online invites) may cause a softlock. You may need an alternative input method to navigate these menus, such as [[a typing keyboard or a gamepad]](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/ctrls#gamepads).

**Click on the Pads icon at the top of RPCS3**.  
<Image src={rpcs3pad} alt="The Pads menu in RPCS3." />

It’s suggested to create a new configuration by clicking `Add Configuration` at the top right of the `Pads` window.  
This is so you can change configuration profiles in case you want to play other games.  
<Image src={rpcs3padprofadd} alt="The top right of RPCS3's Pads window. 'Add Configuration' is being clicked on by the mouse cursor" />
Follow the instructions and/or match the assignments below.

## Pad Information

| Handlers | Devices |
|:--------:|:-------:|
| MMJoystick | Joystick |

| Device Class | Device Subtype |
|:------------:|:--------------:|
| Drums | Guitar Hero |

## Mapping

* Guitar Hero controllers tend to misbehave and **refuse to map sometimes. If you try mapping a button and always get "U+" or something similar, click "Filter Noise"** at the bottom left of the controller configuration window **then try mapping**.

## Profile

[[Download Profile]](https://github.com/hmxmilohax/rb3-pc/raw/refs/heads/main/downloads/instrument-repo/Wii%20Guitar%20Hero%20Drums%20(Raphnet).7z)

<details>
<summary>How do I use profiles?</summary>

<Aside type="caution">This is not recommended if you're using multiple controllers at once.</Aside>

After downloading the profile,

1. Extract the .7z file.
2. Drag the `input configs` folder into the `configs` folder where you have RPCS3 in.  
><Image src={instrepoinstall} alt="Installing a configuration profile from the Instrument Repo" />

3. After that, you can select the profile in the **“Pads”** menu.  
><Image src={rpcs3padprofile} alt="RPCS3's Gamepad Settings, showing the cursor over a profile." />

Most of the time, these controller profiles should work out of the box. If they don’t, try changing the controller listed in “`Devices`”, next to the “`Refresh`” button until it receives an input. You can edit this while the game is running.
