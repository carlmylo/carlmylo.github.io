* None of the controller buttons will work as intended as the keyboard will be in MIDI mode.
* Requires the latest version of [[RPCS3]](https://rpcs3.net/download)
* RPCN Menus (for sending or accepting online invites) will cause a softlock. You will need an alternative input method to navigate these menus, such as a typing keyboard or a gamepad.

## Instructions

There are three different ways to connect this keyboard. Pick whichever is the most convenient for you:

## Setup

<Aside type="caution">Before starting, **make sure you stop Rock Band 3**'s emulation in RPCS3.</Aside>

Be sure to [[download the latest version of Santroller]](https://github.com/santroller/santroller/releases/latest).

After that, start up Santroller.

In the start screen, select your "`Device to program`", "`Connection Method`", and "`Device to Emulate`". This will usually be "`Raspberry Pi Pico`", "`USB Adapter`", and "`Pro Keys`"  respectively.  
After selecting your options, click on `Configure`.

![A screenshot of Santroller's first screen. "Selected Device" is set to Raspberry Pi Pico and Input Type is set to "Directly Wired".](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/instruments/xtra/san/initkeys.png "Santroller: Initialize")

In "`Controller Settings`", change the following:
* Set "`Device to Emulate`" to "`Pro Keys`"
* Enable "`Use USB Passthrough with RPCS3`"

![A screenshot of Santroller's Controller Settings. The settings reflect exactly what is above.](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/instruments/xtra/san/consetkeys.png "Santroller: Controller Settings")

**MAKE SURE YOU CLICK ON "`Save Settings`" before closing the program or you will lose progress!**

![A screenshot of Santroller. The cursor is hovering over "Save Settings".](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/instruments/xtra/san/savesan.png "Santroller")

When you're done, close Santroller.

You can now launch Rock Band 3 and don't need to touch this anymore!

<Aside type="caution">**Make sure Santroller is closed before starting Rock Band 3**!!! Having Santroller open while launching Rock Band 3 will cause passthrough to fail, which means your keyboard will not connect!!!</Aside>
</TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Xbox 360 Wireless Gaming Receiver">
You will need an Xbox 360 Wireless Gaming Receiver for Windows to connect your keyboard to your computer.  
> ![Xbox 360 Wireless Gaming Receiver for Windows](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/btns/ctrls/360/receiver.png "Xbox 360 Wireless Gaming Receiver for Windows")

First, [[download loopMIDI]](https://www.tobias-erichsen.de/software/loopmidi.html).  
> [![A screenshot of loopMIDI's download page.](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/instruments/xtra/midi/midictrlloopMIDIdl.png)](https://www.tobias-erichsen.de/software/loopmidi.html "Tobias Erichsen - loopMIDI")

Install loopMIDI. **Launch it after it finishes.**  
> ![A screenshot of loopMIDI's installer.](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/instruments/xtra/midi/midictrlloopMIDIinst.png "loopMIDI Setup")

Add a port by clicking on the `+` button in the bottom. You should name the port, too. It‚Äôs been named ‚ÄúPro Keys‚Äù in this example.  
> ![A screenshot of loopMIDI, with a mouse cursor over the Plus symbol for "Add Port". Additionally, "New port name" is highlighted in blue with a dotted outline, with "Pro Keys" typed out in the text field.](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/instruments/xtra/midi/360ctrlloopMIDI.png "loopMIDI")

Now, [[download the latest version of RB3_X360_Keyboard by TheNathannator.]](https://github.com/TheNathannator/RB3_X360_Keyboard/releases)  
> ![A screenshot of Github, showing a release for RB3_X360_Keyboard, with a cursor hovering the download.](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/instruments/xtra/midi/360ctrlkeysappdl.png "GitHub: RB3_X360_Keyboard")

Extract it and open it.  
> ![A screenshot of RB3_X360_Keyboard.exe in its folder, with a cursor hovering it.](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/instruments/xtra/midi/360ctrlkeysappopen.png "RB3_X360_Keyboard")

In RB3_X360_Keyboard, set the output type to the port you made earlier and select the port you made earlier.  
After that, click the Start button on the right side.  
![A screenshot of RB3_X360_Keyboard, showing "MIDI" in the "Output Type" section set to "Pro Keys" and highlighted in blue with a dotted outline. "Start" is highlighted in tan with a solid outline](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/instruments/xtra/midi/360ctrlkeysapp1.png "RB3_X360_Keyboard")

![A screenshot of RPCS3's right click menu, showing "Change Custom Configuration" highlighted](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/cust/rpcs3customconfigchange.png "Change Custom Configuration")

![A screenshot of Rock Band 3's I/O custom settings, showing Emulated MIDI Devices, device type, and device selection highlighted in tan with a solid outline.](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/cust/iok.png "I/O")

* ![A tan square with a solid outline](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/cust/smalltan.png "Tan Square"):  
    * üéπ **Leave your "Emulated MIDI type" on "Keyboard" and select your MIDI interface in the drop-down menu next to it.**.

### Additional Information

Since the keyboard controller buttons don't function like they do when connected with a dongle, you will have to shift octaves to access the buttons on the keys.

You can shift octaves with the X and B buttons.

![A GIF of a Rock Band 3 keyboard. When X is pressed, a yellow highlight, showing which notes are being used, shifts down to C2 to C4. When B is pressed, it shifts up to C3 to C5.](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/instruments/xtra/midi/rbkeysoctshift.gif "Octave Shifting")

<summary>[Using a computer keyboard along with a 25 key keyboard]</summary>

<Aside>**This requires advanced setup!**</Aside>

You can use your regular computer keyboard and convert its key presses to the MIDI notes that correspond to the game buttons in case you want to avoid swapping octaves constantly. 
First, [[download loopMIDI]](https://www.tobias-erichsen.de/software/loopmidi.html).  
[![A screenshot of loopMIDI's download page.](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/instruments/xtra/midi/midictrlloopMIDIdl.png)](https://www.tobias-erichsen.de/software/loopmidi.html "Tobias Erichsen - loopMIDI")

Install loopMIDI. **Launch it after it finishes.**  
![A screenshot of loopMIDI's installer.](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/instruments/xtra/midi/midictrlloopMIDIinst.png "loopMIDI Setup")

Add two new ports by clicking on the `+` button in the bottom. You should name the ports, too. They‚Äôve been named ‚ÄúPro Keys‚Äù and ‚ÄúGamepad‚Äù in this example.  
![A screenshot of loopMIDI, with a mouse cursor over the Plus symbol for "Add Port". Additionally, "New port name" is highlighted in blue with a dotted outline, with "Pro Keys" typed out in the text field.](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/instruments/xtra/midi/midictrlloopMIDIaddport.png "loopMIDI")

Now, [[the `.zip` archive that contains the win64 version of FreePiano]](https://freepiano.tiwb.com/en/).  
[![A screenshot of FreePiano's download page.](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/instruments/xtra/midi/midictrlfreepnodl.png)](https://freepiano.tiwb.com/en "FreePiano - Advanced virtual MIDI keyboard")

Extract the `.zip` archive somewhere you can easily find it. It was extracted to `C:Gamesfreepiano` in this example.  

Go to where you extracted FreePiano and run the `freepiano` executable.  
![A screenshot showing the FreePiano executable highlighted.](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/instruments/xtra/midi/midictrlfreepnodir.png "freepiano.exe")

Assign the keys to your liking as shown in the [**[#mapping]**](#mapping) section above.  

There is also a premade profile if you‚Äôd like, which you can [**[download here]**](https://github.com/hmxmilohax/rb3-pc/raw/refs/heads/main/downloads/instrument-repo/rb3gamekeys.map).  

To use the preset, place the `rb3gamekeys.map` file in the `keymap` folder located where you extracted FreePiano.  
![A screenshot of the profile, named rb3gamekeys.map, in the keymap folder, highlighted.](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/instruments/xtra/midi/midictrlfreepnopreset.png "keymap")

Select `rb3gamekeys.map` in the ‚ÄúKeymap‚Äù dropdown button to load the premade profile. Likewise, if you made your own profile or edited the premade profile, you can click on **Save** to save your profile.  
![A screenshot of FreePiano, with the rb3gamekeys.map profile selected.](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/instruments/xtra/midi/midictrlfreepnoselpres.png "rb3gamekeys.map")

The premade profile is mapped like this:

| **Key** | **Action** |
|:---:|:---:|
| Enter | ![Start](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/btns/ctrls/ps3/sta.png "Start") |
| Shift | ![Select](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/btns/ctrls/ps3/sel.png "Select") |
| Up | ![D-Pad Up](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/btns/ctrls/ps3/du.png "D-Pad Up") |

| F | ![Triangle](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/btns/ctrls/ps3/t.png "Triangle") |

Once you are done mapping, click on ‚ÄúInstrument‚Äù at the top of Freepiano‚Äôs window and select the ‚ÄúGamepad‚Äù MIDI output, which you made with loopMIDI earlier.  
![A screenshot of FreePiano's Instrument dropdown menu, with "Gamepad MIDI" selected.](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/instruments/xtra/midi/midictrlfreepnoout.png "Gamepad")

It‚Äôs suggested you enable ‚ÄúBackground input mode‚Äù, located within the ‚ÄúOptions‚Äù tab which is accessed by pressing the Wrench icon in the top right side of FreePiano.  
![A screenshot of FreePiano, with the "Background input mode" enabled.](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/instruments/xtra/midi/midictrlfreepnoback.png "Background input mode")

Now, [[download MIDI-OX]](http://www.midiox.com/moxdown.htm).  
![A screenshot of MIDI-OX's website, with the proper download highlighted in blue with a dotted outline.](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/instruments/xtra/midi/midictrlmidioxdl.png "MIDI-OX 7.0.2")

Install MIDI-OX.  
![A screenshot of MIDI-OX's installer.](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/instruments/xtra/midi/midictrlmidioxinst.png "MIDI-OX Setup Wizard")

Open MIDI-OX then navigate to **Options > MIDI Devices**  
![A screenshot of MIDI-OX, with the mouse hovering over the MIDI Devices menu, under the Options menu.](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/instruments/xtra/midi/midictrlmidioxopts.png "Options > Midi Devices")

In the MIDI Devices Menu, select your keyboard and the port you made in loopMIDI (‚ÄúGamepad‚Äù) for FreePiano in the MIDI Inputs section.  
Select the other port you made in loopMIDI (‚ÄúPro Keys‚Äù) in the MIDI Outputs. This will combine both MIDI inputs into a single output.  
![A screenshot of MIDI-OX's MIDI Devices, with a keyboard and the Gamepad selected in the MIDI Inputs section and Pro Keys selected in the MIDI Outputs section.](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/instruments/xtra/midi/midictrlmidioxcombo.png "MIDI Devices")

Finally, in RPCS3, go to Rock Band 3‚Äôs Custom Configuration then go to the I/O tab. Select the port that you selected as your output in MIDI-OX (‚ÄúPro Keys‚Äù).  
![A screenshot of Rock Band 3's I/O custom settings, showing Emulated MIDI Devices, device type, and device selection highlighted in tan with a solid outline. It is set to "Keyboard - Pro Keys 3"](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/instruments/xtra/midi/midictrlrpcs3.png "Settings: [BLUS30463] Rock Band 3")

That‚Äôs it. Remember to close all **three different programs** when you‚Äôre not using them because they may cause issues with certain shortcuts on Windows.  
You will have to reopen these programs every time you want to play.

</TabItem>
  <TabItem label="MIDI to USB interface">
You will need to connect to your keyboard via the MIDI port on the side.  
> ![A picture of a Rock Band 3's Wireless Keyboard, showing a 5-DIN MIDI input and output highlighted in blue with a dotted white outline.](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/midi/rbkeys.png "Rock Band Wireless Keyboard")

**For this, you will need a MIDI to USB interface**.  
Here‚Äôs an example of a MIDI to USB interface. Most will come with an LED indicator to show activity. **To check that you‚Äôve plugged it in correctly, you should see ‚ÄúMIDI In‚Äù blinking when you press a key**.  
> ![A picture of a MIDI to USB interface.](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/midi/miditousb.png "MIDI to USB interface")

**If you have an audio interface, you may already have a way to plug in MIDI** to your computer, as some audio interfaces come with MIDI inputs. For example, this Scarlett has MIDI connections in the back.

Finally, in RPCS3, go to Rock Band 3‚Äôs Custom Configuration then go to the I/O tab. Select the port that you selected as your output in MIDI-OX (‚ÄúPro Keys‚Äù).

That‚Äôs it. Remember to close all **three different programs** when you‚Äôre not using them because they may cause issues with certain shortcuts on Windows.  
You will have to reopen these programs every time you want to play.
