<summary>My game crashes on boot.</summary>
* You probably installed the [**[High Memory File]**](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/memory) and forgot to enable “Debug Console Mode” in the [[Advanced tab when setting up the Custom Configuration]](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/custom_config_adv) for Rock Band 3.
* If you're updating from an older version of Deluxe, you may have incompatible Rock Band 3 Deluxe files. You need to go to Rock Band 3’s Game Data folder in `dev_hdd0\game\BLUS30463\USRDIR` and delete every `.dta` file aside from `dx_high_memory.dta`.
* Make sure you're on the latest firmware.
* Double check your copy of Rock Band 3.
* Make sure you actually meet the requirements to play this.

You didn’t read the guide and did not install Rock Band 3 Deluxe, which fixes this.
