Have you ever been distracted by your character's guitar, hair, or hat's sudden attempt at traveling to space?

You can eliminate these teleportation bugs by installing a community made patch.  
First, download the [[`rb3_ps3_guitar_glitch_fix.7z` archive]](https://github.com/hmxmilohax/rock-band-3-deluxe/raw/develop/dependencies/ps3_patcher/rb3_ps3_guitar_glitch_fix.7z).

Extract the `rb3_ps3_guitar_glitch_fix.7z` archive.  
Move this window to the right and leave it open.

Next, go to where your game's disc folder is located.  
The quickest way to get there is to right click Rock Band 3 in RPCS3  
and go to `Open Folder > Open Disc Game Folder`.  
Move this window to the left.

After that, drag the `PS3_GAME` folder from the `rb3_ps3_guitar_glitch_fix` folder window on the right into the folder that contains your copy of Rock Band 3.  
Click `Replace the file in the destination` when prompted.

That's it!
