<summary>My character has bugged textures/graphics. ![A screenshot of Rock Band 3, with a character displaying severe texture issues.](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/trbl/common/wcb.png "Graphical issues")</summary>

You did not follow the guide and did not install a [[quick configuration profile]](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/gs_quick_config), or did not [**[enable Write Color Buffers in the GPU section]**](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/custom_config#custom-configuration).

This is an issue that happens on real hardware (PS3) but is MUCH worse on RPCS3.  
Thankfully, there is a patch to fix all of this!  
[[Click here for more information]](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/teleporting).

<summary>[Online] I crash when joining sessions/searching for players.</summary>

Your router may have issues with RPCS3’s UPNP feature.

Go to Rock Band 3’s Custom Configuration [[`Network section`]](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/custom_config_net), and disable “Enable UPNP.”

You will need to [[to set up port forwarding in your router's control panel]](https://www.noip.com/support/knowledgebase/general-port-forwarding-guide).

<summary>My game feels off.</summary>
* Calibrate your game in Rock Band 3’s System Settings.
* Disable “Dolby Digital” if it’s enabled as well.  
    * You can access the system menu by going to: `Menu > Options > System Settings`
* Avoid using HDMI ARC.
* Connect straight to a sound system if possible.

<summary>I'm having horrible performance.</summary>
* Set your computer to the [[High Performance power plan]](https://help.ableton.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000211304-Using-the-High-performance-power-plan-Windows-).
* Go back to the [[Custom Configuration setup section]](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/custom_config#custom-configuration) and apply suggested low performance tweaks.
* Disable Post Effects in Deluxe Settings.
    * `Menu > Options > Deluxe Settings > Graphics`
* If your motherboard has a Realtek audio chip (most computers), try installing the latest driver from your motherboard's "Downloads" page. This is a [[known issue]](https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/issues/14648) where using the default "High Definition Audio" driver doesn’t use all threads.
* Close out the dedicated Discord client and open it up in your browser or on your phone. You can also try an alternative Discord client [[like Vesktop]](https://github.com/Vencord/Vesktop), but we claim no responsibility for your Discord account.
* Increase “Audio Buffer Duration” as mentioned in <a href="https://rb3pc.milohax.org/custom_config#configuration" target="_blank">[the Audio tab of Rock Band 3’s Custom Configuration]</a> until the stuttering stops. 100 ms is a great starting point for low end computers.
