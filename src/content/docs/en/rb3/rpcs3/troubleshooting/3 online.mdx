<summary>I can't find a 3rd or 4th player when searching!</summary>
* Port 9103 is blocked. You can either enable UPNP in Rock Band 3’s [\[Network\]](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/custom_config_net) configuration or manually forward port 9103 (UDP) in your firewall.
    **Don’t enable UPNP while port forwarding** as this can cause crashes.
* Rock Band 3 online lobbies can only have 2 slots of Guitar/Bass/Keys, one Drums slot, and one Vocal slot.  
![A diagram of Rock Band 3's multiplayer slots. It shows a guitar, bass, and keyboard on slot 1 and 4, drums on slot 2, and vocals on slot 3.](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/trbl/online/slotdiag.png)
    * You can bypass this with Rock Band 3 Deluxe with its ability to change instrument type at  
        `Menu > Options > Deluxe Settings > Advanced > Controller > Change Instrument Type`  
        You will still be able to pick the part you want when the song’s part select screen comes up.  
        
<Aside>**You currently cannot play two of the same part**, except for vocals. This means no double guitar or double drum sessions.</Aside>
