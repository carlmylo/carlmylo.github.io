<Aside type="caution">DISCLAIMER - READ BEFORE CONTINUING</Aside>
  Do this as a **last resort** if the charts you want to convert were specifically made for PC clone games (Clone Hero/YARG). If the chart originally existed in RB format, whether it be official DLC or customs, **get that first and follow [[the Xbox 360 to PS3 guide]](2-360tops3/)!**

**Failure to do so will result in lost metadata** associated with the original song package, including:
* Incompatibility with any song upgrades in RB3DX
* Keys, Pro Guitar, Harmonies, & chart fixes to legacy RB songs that didn't have them
* Incompatibility with online play and leaderboards
* Animation data such as character lipsync will be lost

Should you decide to ignore the disclaimer and proceed, you will be **refused any support** from the MiloHax Discord if you run into any issues.

#### 1.
After downloading the charts you want, open Onyx and select `Batch recompile`.

#### 2.
At the top of the Batch Recompile window, click on `Edit` then `Preferences`.  
![A screenshot of Onyx's Batch Recompile. The "Edit" menu has been expanded and "Preferences" is selected.](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/xtra/customs/onyxbatchprefs.png "Batch Recompile")

#### 3.
Switch to the `Rock Band` tab. 
Change to `Magma optional`.  
![A screenshot of Onyx's Preferences window. Under the "Rock Band" tab, "Magma optional" is selected.](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/xtra/customs/onyxbatchprefsrb.png "Batch Recompile")

#### 4.
You will be warned about this.  
Click `OK`.

#### 5.
Switch to the `Audio` tab. 
Lower the `OGG Vorbis quality` to `3.00`.  
After that, click on `Save`.

#### 6.
Drag and drop the folder(s) containing the songs you want to convert into the `Batch recompile` window.

#### 7.
Switch to the `RB3` tab.  
*(Optional)* Most Clone Hero songs only have Guitar charted. You may wish to copy it over to other instruments such as Bass/Keys to allow more people to play it at the same time.  
![A screenshot of Onyx's Batch Recompile window. Under the "RB3" tab, "Fill empty parts with first guitar, then drums" is selected.](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/xtra/customs/onyxbatchparts.png "Batch Recompile")

#### 8.
To finish, select either `Create PS3 PKG files` or `Create PS3/RPCS3 folders`.  
* `Create PS3/RPCS3 folders` is recommended for RPCS3 users and PS3 users who know how to use FTP. It is **much** faster than PKG creation.
* `Create PS3 PKG files` is only recommended for PS3 users who can only use USB flash drives to add more songs.
