When it's done, you can close Nautilus.

#### 7.
Stay on the `RB quick convert + pack creator` tab.  
You can either drag and drop the files you modified or click on `Add Rock Band Song` to select them.

It is also recommended to enable `Author to DTA tag` at the bottom right.  
![A screenshot of Onyx's Quick Convert screen. "Author to DTA" is highlighted and has a cursor over it.](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/xtra/customs/onyxauthor.png "Quick Convert")

#### 8.
Below the first row of gray buttons, click the first menu and select `Make Packs` or `Make Songs` depending on how you want to combine your songs (packs are recommended).  
![A screenshot of Onyx's Quick Convert screen. "Make songs: produced a single file for each song" has been clicked and the cursor is over "Make packs: combine songs up to a maximum file size."](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/xtra/customs/onyxmakepacks.png "Quick Convert")

#### 9.
At the bottom left, make sure `Encrypt .mid.edat` is enabled, then select between either `PKG (PS3)` or `Folders (PS3)`.  
* `Folders (PS3)` is recommended for RPCS3 users and PS3 users who know how to use FTP. It is **much** faster than PKG creation.
* `PKG (PS3)` is only recommended for PS3 users who can only use USB flash drives to add more songs.

#### 10.

_(Optional but highly recommended)_  
By default, Onyx will generate a folder with a name based on the first (or only) song in the pack, like `OxxxxxSongName`.  
It's suggested to enter a custom name. Simply change `Combine into one new USRDIR subfolder per pack` to `Custom USRDIR subfolder`.  
![A screenshot of Onyx's Quick Convert screen. The cursor is selecting "Custom USRDIR subfolder" where "Keep original USRDIR subfolders" once was.](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/xtra/customs/onyxfoldernamerpcs3.png "Quick Convert")

It's suggested for single songs too, as it's easier to locate a song you already installed within the game files.

At the bottom, select the big button labeled `Make pack` (or `Start` if you used the `Make Songs` option.)  
![A screenshot of Onyx's Quick Convert screen. The cursor is over "Make 1 pack."](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/xtra/customs/onyxmakepackrpcs3.png "Quick Convert")

Navigate to your RPCS3 folder and select the `dev_hdd0` folder.  
If youâ€™re going to be installing to a PS3 via FTP, select the most convenient folder.  
![A screenshot of a file browser window. "dev_hdd0" is selected and the cursor is over "Select folder."](https://rb3pc.milohax.org/images/xtra/customs/savefolder.png "Select Folder")

It should successfully convert and auto-install into your RPCS3 directory, ready to play.
